# jetz hacked for perlego

This is a version of jetz hacked to work for  [perlego](https://www.perlego.com), a library of millions of online books.

Unfortunately Perlego has is own format to protect content and stanrdad jetz does not work.

I hacked jetz to work on perlego.

Normal way of jetz is: you click on the extension and it lets you to select a div and its siblings. I switched to selecting only a single div because the multiple selection does not work.

Furthermore, to avoid to have to click on the extension to select each section of the text, I enabled the right click to immediately speed read the current div. Note that you have to move also the mouse to a part of the page that empty of text.

I know, it is a mess. But I told you, it is an hack and works well for me.
